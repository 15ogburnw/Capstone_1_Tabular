# Tabular

Tabular is a simple extension of the popular guitar, drum, and bass tab platform Songsterr. Tabular was designed as a more user-friendly interface for creating and organizing playlists of Songsterr tabs, as well as adding a social element to the user experience. The app contains basic user authentication and profile customization, and allows users to connect with other musicians to view and save their playlists. The application is hosted on Render and can be accessed at the link below:

## Features/User Flow

After creating a profile in Tabular, users can customize their profile with a profile photo, cover photo, bio, and instrument. From the homepage, they are directed to search for songs or other users to connect with. They can search the Songsterr archive for new music, like songs, and create playlists. Songs in Tabular link directly to the Songsterr tab page for the song. Members of Tabular can also search for other users to connect with and send them a friend request. After befriending a user, the friend's playlists are accessible to view and save to your liked playlists.
